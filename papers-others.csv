This limitation combined with the lack of knowledge in sign language by verbal speakers creates a separation where both parties (signers and non-signers) are unable to efficiently communicate, a problem that increases under a specific context such as emergency situations, where first-response teams such as EMTs, firefighters or police officers might be unable to properly attend an emergency as interactions between the involved parties becomes a barrier for decision making when time is scarce. Developing a cognitive-capable tool that serves to recognize sign language in a ubiquitous way, is a must to reduce barriers between the deaf and emergency corps under this context. Hand detection is the first step toward building a Costa Rican sign language (LESCO) recognition framework. Important advances in computing, particularly in the area of deep learning, open a new frontier for object recognition that can be leveraged to build a hand detection module. This study trains the MobileNet V1 convolutional neural network against the EgoHands dataset from Indiana University's UI Computer Vision Lab to determine if the dataset itself is sufficient to detect hands in LESCO videos, from five different signers that wear short-sleeve shirts and under complex backgrounds. Those requirements are key to determine the usefulness of the solution as consulted bibliography performs tests with single-color backgrounds and long-sleeve shirts that ease the classification tasks under controlled environments only. The two-step experiment obtained 1) a mean average precision of 96.1% for the EgoHands dataset and 2) a 91% average accuracy for hand detection across the five LESCO videos. Despite the high accuracy reported by the tests in this paper, the hand detection module was unable to detect certain hand shapes such as closed fists and open hands pointing perpendicular to the camera lens, which suggests that the complex egocentric views as captured in the EgoHands dataset might be insufficient for proper hand detection for Costa Rican sign language.",,978-1-7281-5436-7,10.1109/CONTIE49246.2019.00042,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8971435,Sign language recognition;LESCO;hand detection;convolutional neural network;deep learning;machine learning,Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Feature extraction;Videos;Training;Real-time systems;Object detection,cognition;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;decision making;handicapped aids;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;real-time systems;sign language recognition,time hand detection;convolutional neural networks;natural language;nonverbal communication;nonsigners;deaf emergency;Costa Rican sign language recognition framework;hand detection module;MobileNet V1 convolutional neural network;EgoHands dataset;LESCO videos;hand shapes;open hands;Indiana University UI Computer Vision Lab;single-color backgrounds;signers,,5,,32,IEEE,30-Jan-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,Yes ,Yes,,,,,

In this work, we propose a highly precise method to recognize static gestures from a depth data, provided from one of the above mentioned devices.

A multi-layered random forest (MLRF) is then trained to classify the feature vectors, which yields to the recognition of the hand signs. The training time and memory required by MLRF are much smaller, compared to a simple random forest with equivalent precision. This allows to repeat the training procedure of MLRF without significant effort.

The machine learning (ML) based classifiers have been proposed to classify the hand signs from the extracted features. The random forest has been selected as a base classifier. It presented accuracy rates of 98.76% over ISL (Irish sign language) dataset and 98.68% over ASL (American Sign Language) dataset. Other ML-based classifiers are also selected to work with new efficient features such as support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees and naive Bayes.

However, all methods rely directly on the likelihood models of DTW/HMM. We hypothesize that time warping and classification should be separated because of conflicting likelihood modeling demands. To overcome these restrictions, we propose using statistical DTW (SDTW) only for time warping, while classifying the warped features with a different method. Two novel statistical classifiers are proposed - combined discriminative feature detectors (CDFDs) and quadratic classification on DF Fisher mapping (Q-DFFM) - both using a selection of discriminative features (DFs), and are shown to outperform HMM and SDTW. However, we have found that combining likelihoods of multiple models in a second classification stage degrades performance of the proposed classifiers, while improving performance with HMM and SDTW. A proof-of-concept experiment, combining DFFM mappings of multiple SDTW models with SDTW likelihoods, shows that, also for model-combining, hybrid classification can provide significant improvement over SDTW.

A complete vision-based system, consisting of hand gesture acquisition, segmentation, filtering, representation and classification, is developed to robustly classify hand gestures. The algorithms in the subsystems are formulated or selected to optimality classify hand gestures. The gray-scale image of a hand gesture is segmented using a histogram thresholding algorithm. A morphological filtering approach is designed to effectively remove background and object noise in the segmented image. The contour of a gesture is represented by a localized contour sequence whose samples are the perpendicular distances between the contour pixels and the chord connecting the end-points of a window centered on the contour pixels. Gesture similarity is determined by measuring the similarity between the localized contour sequences of the gestures.

In such a scenario, hand gesture offers some unique abilities for HRC to provide nonverbal communication between the user and the robot. This article proposes a novel real-time hand gesture recognition (HGR) technique for mobile robot control application. A compact convolutional neural network (CNN)-based HGR system, denoted as densely connected residual channel attention module (DRCAM), is proposed to recognize the vision-based hand gestures effectively. Since fingers are the most vital sign for HGR, an attention mechanism using multiscale representation is proposed, which emphasizes finger information more effectively. The proposed CNN model employs the cascading structure of residual blocks with a multiscale channel attention module to learn low- to high-level information of hand gestures. In addition, the cascading structures are connected through dense connectivity, which strengthens the feature propagation and facilitates feature reuse. Experiments are conducted on an ingenuously developed dataset and a publicly available American sign language finger-spelling (ASL-FS) benchmarked dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. The experimental result illustrates that the proposed DRCAM network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean accuracy (MA) using the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) test.

In this paper the task of simultaneously recognising object classes, hand gestures and detecting touch events is cast as a single classification problem. A random forest algorithm is employed which adaptively selects and combines a minimal set of appearance, shape and stereo features to achieve maximum class discrimination for a given image. This minimal set leads to both efficiency at run time and good generalisation. Unlike previous stereo works which explicitly construct disparity maps, here the stereo matching costs are used directly as visual cue and only computed on-demand, i.e. only for pixels where they are necessary for recognition.

For example, in Bharatanatyam, an ancient Indian dance form, artists use different hand gestures, body postures and facial expressions to convey the story line. As identification and classification of these complex and multivariant visual images are difficult, it is now being addressed with the help of advanced computer vision techniques and deep neural networks. This work deals with studies in automation of identification, classification and labelling of selected Bharatnatyam gestures, as part of our efforts to preserve this rich cultural heritage for future generations. The classification of the mudras against their true labels was carried out using different singular pre-trained / non-pre-trained as well as stacked ensemble convolutional neural architectures (CNNs). In all, twenty-seven classes of asamyukta hasta (single hand gestures) data were collected from Google, YouTube and few real time performances by artists. Since the background in many frames are highly diverse, the acquired data is real and dynamic, compared to images from closed laboratory settings. The cleansing of mislabeled data from the dataset was done through label transferring based on distance-based similarity metric using convolutional siamese neural network. The classification of mudras was done using different CNN architecture: i) singular models, ii) ensemble models, and iii) few specialized models. This study achieved an accuracy of >95%, both in single and double transfer learning models, as well as their stacked ensemble model. The results emphasize the crucial role of domain similarity of the pre-training / training datasets for improved classification accuracy and, also indicate that doubly pre-trained CNN model yield the highest accuracy.",,978-1-7281-3783-4,10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031185,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031185,Bharatanatyam;Convolutional Neural Networks;Hand Gestures;Convolutional Siamese Neural Network;Ensemble Models;Asamyukta Hastas,Feature extraction;Task analysis;Image edge detection;YouTube;Visualization;Lead,computer vision;convolutional neural nets;data acquisition;face recognition;gesture recognition;humanities;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture,convolutional siamese neural network;CNN architecture;Bharatnatyam gestures;distance-based similarity metric;mislabeled data;stacked ensemble convolutional neural architectures;cultural heritage;deep neural networks;computer vision techniques;multivariant visual images;story line;facial expressions;body postures;hand gestures;ancient Indian dance form;art forms;Bharatanatyam mudra classification;double transfer learning models;single transfer learning models,,3,,25,IEEE,12-Mar-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,No,No,Yes,No,,,

Precise detailed detection of faces and facial features,Liya Ding; A. M.

Algorithms can now quite reliably detect faces in clutter in or near real time. However, much still needs to be done to provide an accurate and detailed description of external and internal features. This paper presents an approach to achieve this goal. Previous learning algorithms have had limited success on this task because the shape and texture of facial features varies widely under changing expression, pose and illumination. We address this problem with the use of subclass divisions. In this approach, we use an algorithm to automatically divide the training samples of each facial feature into a set of subclasses, each representing a distinct construction of the same facial component (e.g., close versus open eye lids). The key idea used to achieve accurate detections is to not only learn the textural information of the facial feature to be detected but that of its context (i.e., surroundings). This process permits a precise detection of key facial features. We then combine this approach with edge and color segmentation to provide an accurate and detailed detection of the shape of the major facial features (brows, eyes, nose, mouth and chin). We use this face detection algorithm to obtain precise descriptions of the facial features in video sequences of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, where the variability in expressions can be extreme. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates our method is almost as precise as manual detection, ~ 2% error.",1063-6919,978-1-4244-2242-5,10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587812,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587812,,Face detection;Facial features;Mouth;Lighting;Eyes;Handicapped aids;Active shape model;Reliability engineering;Image edge detection;Nose,face recognition;image sequences;image texture,faces precise detailed detection;facial features;facial feature;textural information;color segmentation;face detection algorithm;video sequences;American Sign Language sentences,,10,1,17,IEEE,05-Aug-08,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,No,No,Yes,No,,,

In this paper we propose a novel vision system for clustering and classification of object-based video motion clips using spatiotemporal models. Object trajectories are modeled as motion time series using the lowest order Fourier coefficients obtained by Discrete Fourier Transform. Trajectory clustering is then carried out in the DFT-coefficient feature space to discover patterns of similar object motion activity. The DFT coefficients are used as input feature vectors to a Self-Organising Map which can learn similarities between object trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Encoding trajectories in this way leads to efficiency gains over existing approaches that use discrete point-based flow vectors to represent the whole trajectory. Assuming the clusters of trajectory points are distributed normally in the coefficient feature space, we propose a simple Mahalanobis classifier for the detection of anomalous trajectories. Our proposed techniques are validated on three different datasets - Australian sign language, handlabelled object trajectories from video surveillance footage and real-time tracking data obtained in the laboratory.
